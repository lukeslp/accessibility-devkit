# The Layered Approach

Accessibility Devkit has three layers. Each addresses a different part of implementation and can work alone or with the others.

## Layer 1: Testing and Auditing (`@accessibility-devkit/audit`)

This layer is about catching problems early. It integrates into the developer's existing workflow through linting and automated testing.

**What it includes:**

A pre-configured `axe-core` integration for running accessibility audits against rendered DOM. This can be used in unit tests, integration tests, or as a standalone CLI tool. It also includes a pre-configured `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` ruleset for catching common accessibility issues in JSX at the linting stage, before the code even runs.

**When to use it:**

Every project should use this layer. It is the foundation of an accessible development workflow.

## Layer 2: Components and Patterns (`@accessibility-devkit/components`)

This layer provides the building blocks for accessible interfaces. It includes unstyled, framework-agnostic component patterns that handle the complex ARIA and keyboard interaction logic.

**What it includes:**

Focus management utilities (wrapping `focus-trap`), a skip navigation component, a live region announcer for screen readers, and keyboard navigation helpers. These are not styled components; they are behavioral primitives that can be composed into any design system.

**When to use it:**

Use this layer when building custom interactive components like modals, dropdowns, tabs, or any element that requires keyboard navigation and screen reader support.

## Layer 3: Accommodations by disability domain

This layer addresses specific disability needs that go beyond structural accessibility. Most accessibility tooling stops at visual and structural checks. This layer also covers motor, cognitive, sensory, literacy, and vestibular access. It is a family of small, framework-agnostic packages, each mapped to the WCAG success criteria it serves.

### `@accessibility-devkit/accommodations`

Color and perception: color blindness simulation (protanopia, deuteranopia, tritanopia, and the partial variants), WCAG contrast math, automatic color adjustment, system-preference detection (`prefers-reduced-motion`, `prefers-contrast`, `prefers-color-scheme`), dyslexia-friendly typography, and WCAG 1.4.12 text spacing.

### `@accessibility-devkit/motor`

Motor and mobility: target-size checks (2.5.8 / 2.5.5), pointer cancellation (2.5.2), a keyboard alternative to dragging (2.5.7), and tremor tolerance (rapid-repeat suppression, dwell activation). For people who use switches, eye-gaze, head pointers, or who have limited dexterity or tremor.

### `@accessibility-devkit/cognitive`

Cognitive load: adjustable session timeouts with warnings (2.2.1 / 2.2.6), redundant-entry memory (3.3.7), accessible-authentication helpers (3.3.8), and an undo controller for reversible actions (3.3.4 / 3.3.6).

### `@accessibility-devkit/language`

Reading level and literacy: readability scoring (Flesch Reading Ease, Flesch–Kincaid grade, Automated Readability Index), plain-language flags for long sentences and complex words, and abbreviation annotation (3.1.4).

### `@accessibility-devkit/media`

Auditory and media access: caption and audio-description checks (1.2.2 / 1.2.5), autoplay-audio detection and an injected pause control (1.4.2), and transcript association.

### `@accessibility-devkit/motion`

Seizure and vestibular safety: reduced-motion gating (2.3.3), motion-safe scrolling, and flash-rate metering against the three-per-second threshold (2.3.1).

**When to use it:**

Use these packages when you need to go beyond a baseline WCAG scan and actively accommodate specific user needs. Reach for the package that matches the barrier — motor, cognitive, language, media, motion, or general perception — and compose them as your interface requires.
